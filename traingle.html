    <div id="triangle-description" data-animation="fadeIn" class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 animation">
      <p class="lead">At <b>SuprAcademy</b>, we strongly believe that merely offering a traditional tutoring service does not guarantee a student's academic success. We believe in the importance of parental involvement in their child's academic life. As such, we have structured our service around what we call the Triangle of Success.</p>
      <p class="lead">For the academic support service that we provide to have the maximum impact, this triangle must remain intact. If any part of the triangle breaks, the academic support we provide loses its effectiveness.</p>
      <p class="lead">The <b>Triangle of Success</b> has the student, their Guide and the parent at its three vertices. For the Triangle to remain intact, the parent must be satisfied, the student must be happy and SuprAcacdemy must continue to work to make sure that this happens. We understand that the parent's satisfaction is driven from their child's success. So we will work to ensure that this success is achieved.</p>
      <p class="lead">It is also very important that the student is happy with the academic support that we provide. Our friendly, engaging, and fun approach to conducting a session is attractive to students who are often exposed to passive, sit-and-listen, one-way classroom settings. We encourage students to think through their own problems, and review concepts, often by breaking them down into their most basic components and building our way up to their current grade level.</p>
      <p class="lead">SuprAcademy and its Guides serve as the third vertex of the Triangle and make sure that the it remains intact by providing top quality academic support and engaging both the parent and the student. Our Guides have many years of experience working with students, helping them understand math and science concepts by taking student-specific approach. Our primary goal is to help students help themselves. We do this by working with students to make sure that they are learning how to learn. SuprAcademy also ensures that parents are engaged in their child's learning journey. Periodic phone and/or email updates, as well as in-person meetings are arranged with parents to provide feedback on student's session-specific and long-term progress updates.</p>
